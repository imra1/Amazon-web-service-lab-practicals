After that I have sign in to the amazon web services site and satretd the lab sessions.Following are the sessions I have followed.

1. Launch, configure, and access a Linux virtual machine using AWS

By completing this lab I was able to launch and configure first Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console. EC2 provides complete control of computing resources and lets the user run on Amazon’s computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes.

3. Manage the storage space of EC2 instance using Amazon EBS

By completing this lab,I was able to learn to create an EC2 instance with an additional EBS volume. I was able to learn to attach and detach an EBS to/from a specific EC2 instance, take a snapshot, and master how to delete a volume. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.

By completing this lab I was able setup a webserver EC2 instance starting from a Linux AMI, and then generate a new AMI.An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance.We can customize an EC2 instance and then save the configuration as a custom AMI for private or public use. Every EC2 instance launched selecting the customized AMI will contain any software or file that previously added.
