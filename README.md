1. Launch, configure, and access a Linux virtual machine using AWS

By completing this lab I was able to launch and configure first Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console. EC2 provides complete control of computing resources and lets the user run on Amazon’s computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes.
